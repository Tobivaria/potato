# Contributing

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the Repository
2. Add in your changes following the project conventions
3. Add or update any tests
4. Create a pull request
5. Get PR accepted
6. Merge
7. Celebrate you contribution

Other ways to contribute include, but are not limited to:

- Reporting Bugs
- Figma Design
- Reviewing Code
- Writing Documentation
- GitHub/Discord Organization
- CICD Workflow
- Marketing & Copywriting

Rules:

- It is recommended to not make pull requests huge. If you want to implement a huge feature, break it down into multiple issues, and approach it one at a time
- If your code is blocking other people work, need to give daily updates as a comment on the issue, or it will be assigned to someone else.

## Propose Changes

If there is not already an issue that you want to work on, create a `enhancement` issue. Then reach out to one of the collaborators for it to get approved. Then follow the "How to Contribute" section to make changes.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before creating a pull request.
2. Update the pull request with details of changes.
3. Ensure that all the github actions pass.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of one other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request a collaborator to merge it for you.

## Code Reviews

Code reviewers will be expected to assign themselves to any code reviews that they deem capable of reviewing. Once you selected the code to review, assign yourself as a reviewer and you will have 24 hours to complete the code review.

## Testing Guidelines

- Aim for 70% test coverage
- Test everything that makes sense to test (Ex. No need to test if a StatefulWidget holds state)
- All new PRs should have tests updated if necessary, if they are not reviewer should make that an action item
